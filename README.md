# PGA-Tour-Strokes-Gained-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of PGA Tour strokes gained statistics for tournaments from 2015-2022.
The objective is to gain a better understanding of what it takes to win on the PGA Tour using the four published 
strokes gained statistics which are available in the dataset: strokes gained putting (sg_putt), strokes gained 
around the green (sg_arg), strokes gained on approach shots (sg_app), and strokes gained off the tee (sg_ott).  I
also created two combined strokes gained categories in an effort to analyze the impact of the short game (i.e. putting 
and shots around the green) vs. the impact of ball-striking (i.e. approach shots and tee shots).  I named these 
categories sg_putt_arg and sg_app_ott in my analysis.  The sg_putt_arg stat combines the strokes gained putting and 
around the green, and the sg_app_ott combines the strokes gained on approach shots and tee shots.
